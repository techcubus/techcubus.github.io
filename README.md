> "A grimoire is a textbook of magic or a personal, evolving record of a witch's spiritual and magical practices, including spells, rituals, and personal reflections. The word comes from the French term grammaire, meaning "grammar," and it refers to a book of rules or instructions, though in this case, for magic."
